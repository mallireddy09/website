## Deploy

Pushes to `mallikarjun-website` trigger [`.github/workflows/publish.yml`](.github/workflows/publish.yml), which tests, builds, and deploys the site directly to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.

In the repository's **Settings → Pages**, select **GitHub Actions** as the publishing source. The default site URL is [mallireddy09.github.io/website/](https://mallireddy09.github.io/website/).

The build uses the Pages base path for assets and routing, so it also supports a custom domain configured in GitHub Pages. Section links use hashes; `404.html` provides a fallback for older section URLs.
